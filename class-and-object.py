# ================================  CLASS AND OBJECT ==================== #


# it was OOPS --> object oriented programming
# python can use procedural based program and object-oriented  and function based also can write

# class means we going to write all code like blueprint and design


class student:  # ---> this was way to create a class

    def say_hello(self):  # ---> this was way to create a method
        print("Hi, i'm a student")


s1 = student()
s1.say_hello()  # s1.say_hello(s1)-->  python will send like this to the machine


# ================================= constructor ============= #


# _init_ #---> was the constructor
